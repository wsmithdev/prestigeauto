# Welcome to Prestige Auto

## What is Prestige Auto
Prestige Auto motor car club is a fictitious members-only club. When a member signs up, they choose a membership level giving them annual points to spend toward using a fleet of luxury cars. Members can browse the fleet and select a car to book. Members are also able to change their profile information like their name, surname, and profile picture.

If the logged-in user is the administrator, they can create, remove, or update a car in the database.

## How to use Prestige Auto
Sign up or log in using the forms. We testing I have created an "Auto Fill" button on the login page that will log in as the administrator to see all the features of the web application. Feel free to have a look around.
